Of course! Here is a detailed, easy-to-understand documentation for the `VideoRoom.tsx` component.

### Documentation: `VideoRoom` Component

### 1. Overview

Think of the `VideoRoom` component as the **main stage for a video conference call**, similar to what you see in Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams. It's a self-contained unit responsible for displaying all the participants' videos, providing media controls, and managing the overall layout and user experience of a video call.

It brings together many smaller, specialized components (like the video grid, chat panel, and controls) to create a complete and functional video room.

### 2. How to Use It (Props)

You can customize the `VideoRoom` by passing it different "props" (properties). These are the main settings you can control from the outside.

| Prop           | Type             | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `roomName`     | `string`         | **Required.** The unique name or ID for the video room. Used for things like the recording filename.              |
| `initialVideo` | `boolean`        | (Optional) Should the user's camera be turned **on** by default when they join? Defaults to `false` (off).       |
| `initialAudio` | `boolean`        | (Optional) Should the user's microphone be turned **on** by default when they join? Defaults to `false` (off).   |
| `isBanned`     | `boolean`        | (Optional) If `true`, the user will be blocked from entering and will see a "Banned" screen instead of the room. |
| `isMuted`      | `boolean`        | (Optional) If `true`, the user will enter the room with both their camera and microphone forcibly turned off.      |
| `banReason`    | `string \| null` | (Optional) If the user is banned, this is the reason displayed to them on the banned screen.                     |

### 3. Key Features & Logic

This component contains all the logic to make the video room interactive and intelligent.

#### a. Screen Recording

This is one of the component's most powerful features. It allows the user to record the meeting **locally to their own computer**.

*   **`handleStartRecording()`**:
    1.  Shows a friendly notification ("toast") telling the user what's about to happen.
    2.  Uses the browser's built-in `getDisplayMedia` API to open a dialog asking the user to **select a window or screen to record**.
    3.  It also tries to capture the user's microphone audio and combines it with the screen capture.
    4.  It starts recording the selected screen and audio into a video file (MP4 if supported, otherwise WebM).
*   **`handleStopRecording()`**:
    1.  Safely stops the recording.
    2.  Takes all the recorded video chunks and combines them into a single video file (a "Blob").
*   **`handleDownloadRecording()`**:
    1.  Once the recording is stopped, a "Download" panel appears.
    2.  Clicking the download button uses the `file-saver` library to save the video file to the user's computer with a descriptive name (e.g., `meeting-room-name-date.mp4`).

#### b. Layout Management

The room can automatically change its layout to best fit the current situation.

*   **Grid Layout (`"grid"`)**: The default view. All participants are shown in a grid, like the "Brady Bunch" view.
*   **Presentation Layout (`"presentation"`)**: This layout is activated **automatically** when someone starts sharing their screen. The shared screen takes up the main, large area, and all other participants are shown in a smaller strip at the bottom. When screen sharing stops, it automatically switches back to the grid layout.

#### c. Side Panels (Chat, Participants, Settings)

The component manages three side panels that can be toggled on and off.

*   **`activePanel` (State)**: This piece of state keeps track of which panel is currently open: `"chat"`, `"participants"`, `"settings"`, or `null` (none).
*   **Desktop View**: On larger screens, the active panel slides in from the right side of the screen.
*   **Mobile View**: On smaller screens (detected automatically), the active panel slides in as a "sheet" that covers most of the screen, providing a better experience on a small display.

#### d. Handling Muted or Banned Users

The component can handle special states for a user before they even join the room.

*   **`BannedScreen`**: If the `isBanned` prop is `true`, the component doesn't render the video room at all. Instead, it shows a simple, clean screen informing the user that they are banned and displaying the reason, if one is provided.
*   **Pre-Muted State**: If the `isMuted` prop is `true`, the user can join the room, but the component ensures their camera and microphone are turned off from the very start. The controls to turn them on are also disabled.

### 4. Sub-Components (The Building Blocks)

The `VideoRoom` is a "manager" component. It uses several smaller, more focused components to build the final UI.

| Component           | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `VideoGrid`         | Responsible for arranging all the participant videos in a grid.                 |
| `VideoTile`         | The individual video box for a single participant.                              |
| `ScreenShareTile`   | A special, larger tile used to display a participant's shared screen.           |
| `MediaControls`     | The main control bar at the bottom with buttons for mic, camera, chat, etc.     |
| `RoomChat`          | The panel that contains the text chat interface for the room.                   |
| `ParticipantsList`  | The panel that lists all the participants currently in the room.                |
| `RoomSettings`      | The panel where the user can change their camera and microphone devices.        |
| `Sheet` (from UI library) | A UI element used for the pop-over panels on mobile devices.              |

### 5. Summary

In essence, this component is the **complete user interface for a video call**. It's designed to be smart and responsive, automatically handling different layouts for screen sharing and adapting its design for both desktop and mobile users, while also providing advanced features like local recording and moderation controls (banning/muting).
